The `install.sh` script is executed upon a workspace build in [Coder](https://github.com/coder) to configure my workspace just the way I like it.

The key configs:

- Fish shell
- [Starship](starship.rs) to customize my (rare) fish
- VSCode extensions to make my editor look inviting
- Tooling I use to provision & manage infra
