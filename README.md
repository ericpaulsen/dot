The `install.sh` script is executed during the [Coder](https://github.com/coder) build to configure my workspace just the way I like it.

Key configs:

- Fish shell
- [Starship](starship.rs) to customize my (rare) fish
- VSCode extensions to make my editor look inviting
- Tooling I use to provision & manage infra
